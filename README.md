	   <p1 id="lenovo">Tanzania’s abolition of secondary school fees and contributions 
	   has been a huge step toward improving access to secondary education,
	   ” said Elin Martínez, children’s rights researcher at Human Rights 
	   Watch and author of the report. “But the government should do more 
	   to address the crowded classrooms, discrimination, and abuse that 
	   undermine many adolescents’ education.”</p1>

	   school students, out-of-school adolescents, parents, education experts, 
	   local activists, development partners, and national and local government 
	   officials in eight districts in four regions of Tanzania. The research 
	   coincided with the rollout of free lower-secondary education for Form I 
	   to Form IV students across the country.”</p1>

	   <p1 id="lenovo">Quality secondary education also remains inaccessible for most 
	   adolescents with disabilities. Despite the government’s comprehensive 
	   inclusive education plan, schools are often insufficiently equipped or 
	   resourced to accommodate children with various types of disabilities. 
	   Most teachers lack inclusive education training. The government should 
	   ensure that students with disabilities have adequate support to enable 
	   them to learn on an equal basis with students without disabilities.</p1>
